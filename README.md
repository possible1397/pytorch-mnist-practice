ðŸ§  PyTorch MNIST Classifier Practice

This is a beginner-friendly PyTorch project for training a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

## ðŸ“Œ Project Features

- âœ… Trains a basic **MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)** model
- âœ… Achieves over **94% accuracy** on the MNIST test set
- âœ… Includes a 3-layer MLP visualization script to understand hidden layers and ReLU activation
- âœ… Cleans up unnecessary files using `.gitignore` for a clean GitHub repo

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
 â”œâ”€â”€ mnist_train.py # Main training script (MLP on MNIST) â”œâ”€â”€ pytorch 3nn.py # Toy example of 3-layer NN with ReLU and visualization â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore # Files/folders excluded from version control
## ðŸš€ How to Run

Make sure you have Python + PyTorch installed.

Install dependencies (if not already):
```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib

Run the training script:
python mnist_train.py

Optional: Visualize the 3-layer network behavior with:
python "pytorch 3nn.py"

ðŸ§  Learning Focus
This project is designed to practice:

How neural networks learn from data

The structure of feedforward networks (MLPs)

How ReLU activation transforms intermediate layers

Using torch, nn, DataLoader, optimizer, and loss

ðŸ›  To-Do / Future Work
 Convert model to CNN for higher accuracy

 Save and load .pt model files

 Add evaluation report and confusion matrix

 Deploy as a web app using Gradio or Streamlit
